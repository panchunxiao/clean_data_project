# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository is about the data tidying of the dataset of Human
Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

Files CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data,
and any transformations or work

run_analysis.R performs the data preparation and follows the 5
requirements of the project, which are: 1. Merges the training and the
test sets to create one data set. 2. Extracts only the measurements on
the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 3. Uses
descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 4.
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 5.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set
with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

tidaydata2.txt is the final answer for requirement 5
